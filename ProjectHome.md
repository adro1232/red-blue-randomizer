> --Overview--

Since no issues were reported from the last beta, I've decided to promote that build to v1.0.  I've also included in this release a native OSX version to help the Mac users who were having issues getting the Java version starting.  Please report any issues to Ubuntaur@gmail.com.

> --Special thanks--

The inspiration for this project came from artemis251's Pokemon Emerald Randomizer. It's a very fun
application that made me want to see randomization implemented for Red and Blue. Please check out his project
located here: http://artemis251.fobby.net/downloads/emerald/

I would also like to mention Sean Luke for his Java implementation of the Mersenne Twister which I used for
random number generation. His site can be found here: http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/research/
